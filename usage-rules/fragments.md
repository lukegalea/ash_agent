# AshAgent fragments

## `AshAgent.Invocation`

One row for each request to run an action that has effects: a stable key, a keyed digest of the arguments, a lease
that fences stale workers, and a typed outcome. Include it on a resource built from your own base:

```elixir
defmodule MyClinic.Execution.Invocation do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: MyClinic.Execution,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
    extensions: [AshOban],
    fragments: [AshAgent.Invocation]

  postgres do
    table "invocations"
    repo MyClinic.Repo
  end

  invocation do
    execution_identity MyClinic.ExecutionIdentity
    digest_key MyClinic.InvocationDigestKey
  end

  oban do
    triggers do
      trigger :execute do
        # see triggers.md
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Expose `invoke` through a code interface on your domain; it is the entry point:

```elixir
resource MyClinic.Execution.Invocation do
  define :invoke, action: :invoke, args: [:target, :args]
end

MyClinic.Execution.invoke(
  "MyClinic.Credentials.Credential.activate",
  %{"id" => credential_id},
  %{key: "review:#{review_id}"},
  actor: nurse
)
```

### Rules

1. A target is `"<resource module>.<action>"`, and only an action with an `effects` declaration can be invoked.
   Declare every action you mean to govern.
2. `args` is the action's inputs as JSON would carry them; for an update or a destroy it also carries the subject's
   primary key. The request checks them against the action without running it or its changes, and records a row that
   does not fit as `rejected`.
3. Use one key per request. The same key with the same target, arguments, principal and parent returns the existing
   row; the same key with anything different is `AshAgent.Invocation.IdempotencyConflict`. Nothing is upserted.
4. Do not call `invoke` inside a transaction you opened: a concurrent request with the same key is detected by the
   key's unique identity, and the failed insert would abort your transaction.
5. `request` derives everything else on the row (principal, kind, mode, lineage, the effects snapshot, digests,
   preconditions, status). Do not add actions that accept those columns.
6. A row in `succeeded`, `failed`, `rejected`, `stale` or `cancelled` never changes. Do not add update actions that
   bypass the state machine.
7. If your audit wrapper refuses atomic updates, nothing changes: fencing is a filter on the update plus
   `optimistic_lock`, never an atomic update.
8. Set `lifecycle?: false` (or the equivalent) if your base resource installs a state machine of its own: the
   fragment's state machine is the row's lifecycle, and two do not merge.

### What you add on the resource

| You add | Why |
|---|---|
| Tenancy and an owner column | The fragment has neither; stamp the owner on `request` from the actor |
| Policies | `invoke` and `request` for the people who may ask; `claim`, `succeed`, `fail`, `apply_decision` and `execute` for your job runner alone |
| Encryption of `args` and `result` | Both are marked `sensitive?`; seal them if you encrypt content at rest |
| A check of `parent` | The fragment records the parent; whether the requester may name it is yours to decide |
| The `:execute` trigger | `request` and `apply_decision` enqueue it for every ready row |
| Approval opening and deciding | Attach a change to `request` (rows that land in `awaiting_approval`) and to `apply_decision` (set its `outcome`) |
| Any check at claim | Attach a change to `claim`, for example re-checking an approval before work starts |

A change you attach with `changes do change MyChange, where: [action_is(:claim)] end` runs after the fragment's own
changes for that action and before its hooks.
